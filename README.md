**Author**: Matthew Simms

## Overview
Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) 

## Getting Started
 What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? 

## Architecture
 Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. 

## Change Log
Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

03-01-2021 5:20pm - Application created.
03-01-2021 6:30pm - Application has a working index.ejs file that renders on the page when '/hello' is called.
